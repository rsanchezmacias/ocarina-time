# ocarina-time

This project is inspired by *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*. It tries to mimic playing the ocarina songs on the 
keyboard as you would in a Nintendo console. 

The application is written in pure HTML, CSS, and JS. I use sound effects from [Legend of Zelda Sound Effects](http://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/) by HelpTheWretched,
songs from [Video Game Music](https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-original-sound-track), and icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons/set/mute-unmute). 

This project was done as part of Dr. Angela Yu's web development bootcamp, [*The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp*](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).
